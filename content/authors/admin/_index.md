I am a professor for research methods and diagnostics at the department of inclusive education at the University of Potsdam in Germany. I studied education sciences at the University of Cologne where I also did my Phd in cognitive psychology. Thereafter, I got a tenured position as a senior researcher at the department of special education (also University of Cologne). Later I did my habilitation on “Pedagocics and psychology in learning disabilities” at the Carl von Osietzky University Oldenburg.
